FIXED / COMPLETED
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Add trailers / images / other media in the show page. ✔
2. Fix "popular" page loading time. ✔
3. Try refactoring TMDB service, this file has a lot of duplicate code. ✔
4. Inside the show page for some media, the ratings table could get extremely large, so define max height ✔
5. Add an additional layout in list so that content could be displayed in a grid / list. ✔



TODO
--------------------------------------------------------
1. On the show page, ability to click on an actor and see their movies / shows etc? ( idk if worth it )
2. Add search by more criteria then title like actors | genre | year ?

General
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Think up more features to add, site looks bland / empty.
